            <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <p>This "Agreement" is made effective as of the time of the check-out, between the "Client", and Rent-a-Friend LLC.</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Services Provided: 
                <ul>
                <li>The Company agrees to provide the Client with the following services:</li>
                <li>Renting out individuals pretending to be friends for various social activities, including but not limited to: weddings, parties, family gatherings, and awkward office functions.</li>
                <li>The Company shall ensure that all rented friends possess basic acting skills to maintain the illusion of genuine friendship.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Payment: In consideration for the services provided, the Client agrees to pay the Company an exorbitant fee in unmarked bills, hidden inside a hollowed-out book, delivered under the cover of darkness to a predetermined location.</li>
                <li>Confidentiality: The Client agrees to maintain absolute secrecy regarding the true nature of the rented friendships and shall not disclose any details about the Company's operations to law enforcement, nosy neighbors, or competing friendship rental agencies.</li>
                <li>Illegal Activities: Both parties acknowledge that certain activities facilitated by the rented friends may be of questionable legality. The Client agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from any legal consequences arising from said activities, including but not limited to: identity theft, espionage, and smuggling exotic animals.</li>
                <li>Dispute Resolution: In the event of a dispute, both parties agree to settle matters through a game of rock-paper-scissors, best two out of three, with the loser bearing all legal costs and consequences.</li>
                <li>Termination: Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason, provided that the Client returns any rented friends in their original condition (excluding normal wear and tear). This contract is legally binding in the Twilight Zone and other parallel dimensions where sanity and legality may vary.</li>
              </ol>
