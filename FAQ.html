        <div class="QApair">
            <p class="question" >Q: Why would I pay to rent a friend? Can't I just make friends for free?</p>
            <p class="answer" >A: Sure, you can attempt the awkward small talk at the local coffee shop,
                or you could fast-track to friendliness with our awesome service. Plus, 
                our friends come with a satisfaction guarantee,  no awkward silences or 
                judgmental looks included. </p>

        <div class="QApair">
            <p class="question" >Q: Is this like a dating service?</p>
            <p  class="answer" >A: Nope, not even close. We're all about platonic love here. No 
                candlelit dinners or lovey-dovey stuff. Just good old-fashioned 
                friendship, without the pressure or the romance. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="QApair">
                <p class="question" >Q: Are your friends certified to be awesome?</p>
                <p  class="answer" >A: Absolutely! Our friends undergo a rigorous process that includes 
                a "coolness" assessment, a joke-telling competition, and a dance-off 
                (optional but highly encouraged). We only hire the coolest, quirkiest, 
                and most entertaining individuals.</p>

        <div class="QApair">
                <p class="question" >Q: What if I don't like the friend I've rented?</p>
                <p  class="answer" >A: Well, we can't guarantee you'll love everyone, but we'll do our 
                best to match you with someone you'll vibe with. If it's not a match 
                made in friendship heaven, let us know, and we'll find you a better 
                fit. We're like the Tinder of friendships, but with less swiping.</p>

                <p class="question" >Q: Can I rent a friend for family gatherings or work events?</p>
                <p  class="answer" >A: Absolutely! Our friends are pros at navigating awkward family 
                dinners and excelling at office small talk. They'll make you look good, 
                and you might even get a promotion for having the coolest friend in the
                room.</p>

            <p class="answer" > A: Of course! We're not in the business of breaking laws or hearts.
            Our service is as legit as your grandma's secret cookie recipe.</p>
